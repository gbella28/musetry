After attending the SheCodes introductory webinar, I was inspired by their live demonstration of using VS Code to give it a try myself. I have no prior knowledge of coding, yet found giving VS Code a try to be very simple and fun.

💭Reflection

This was a very fun experience and I'm excited to continue my coding journey through various mini projects like this one. I've found that there are many more customizations to learn and will do so with time. My next steps likely include completing coding certification through SheCodes and creating a project throught their Basics program. Further, this project provided insight on how to utilize GitHub pages as well as what to include when providing project details.
