  <h2>How do we define "poetry?"</h2>
  <p>
    "Poetry is a form of literary art that uses aesthetic and often rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, literal or surface-level meanings." — Wikipedia
  </p>

  <h2>Song Interpretations</h2>
  <p>
    The commonly true stereotype of English teachers asking students to analyze the color of a couch in the latest reading assignment also has merit in the music department. While artists may not directly ask this of listeners, many fans often decipher messages the artist may intend to convey, or assign their own personal interpretations to lyrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, "She's Thunderstorms" by Arctic Monkeys features artist Alex Turner singing about his muse. He's been noted to have said, "I’m always trying to think of different interesting ways to describe somebody but compliment them too. So in that one, I like the idea that she’s not even a thunderstorm, she’s more than one. I quite like the fact she’s plural. 'Thunderstorms’ meaning just, y’know, awesome!"
  </p>
  <p>
    Although I've listened to this song enough times for it to be in my Top 5 on Spotify Wrapped, I've always interpreted his muse as someone grungy or who fits the "downtown/grunge" aesthetic (see below) that he is head over heels for. Yet to my surprise, many of the lyrics refer to the sexual side of their relationship.

  <h2>Why Different Views?</h2>
  <p>
    There will always be that one kid who chooses to play devil's advocate and pick an obscure or frowned upon stance. However, I've been taught in these classes that any claim can exist as long as you have evidence to support it. You can also analyze evidence to present deeper implications that you wouldn't see on the surface.
  </p>

  <h4>
    She's thunderstorms, lying on her front<br />
    Up against the wall, she's thunderstorms<br />
    Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close<br />
    When the heat starts growing horns, she's thunderstorms<br />
    She's been loop-the-looping around my mind<br />
    Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of<br />
    Acrobatic blood, concertina<br />
    Cheating heartbeat, rapid fire
  </h4>

  <p>
    You can see why the idea of heat with horns and motorcycle boots would make me picture someone who would match the above Pinterest aesthetic. However, it has come to my attention that the horn statement is referring to an erection...
  </p>

  <p>
    Neither interpretation is necessarily wrong, but one could argue the original intent of the artist overrides personal opinions. The point is, the lyrics (or lines) in this song have meaning that definitely goes beyond face value — but how they're decoded is based on the listener and how the music makes them feel. Of course, Turner isn't saying he is in love with an actual thunderstorm, but one could interpret that as him saying his lover has an electric and loud personality.

    I have always been a firm believer that music is one of the most poetic art forms out there besides actual poetry itself. If my insight isn't enough,
    <a href="https://songmeanings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take a look at your favorite song here 🔎</a>
    and see what others are saying, or give "She's Thunderstorms"
